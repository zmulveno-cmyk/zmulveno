            <h2>Zoei Mulvenon</h2>
          <p>
            I am a third-year Media Arts and Sciences major at Arizona State University, 
            passionate about combining creativity and technology. I have experience in design, 
            digital media, and web development. I enjoy creating visually engaging projects 
            using HTML, CSS, animations, and storytelling. I am proficient with tools such as 
            Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Canva, and Max 9. I continually explore 
            new software to expand my creative toolkit. My goal is to build projects that are not 
            only aesthetically striking but also user-friendly and innovative.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to my technical work, I have a strong interest in philosophy and creative writing,
            which informs the way I approach storytelling, conceptual thinking, and problem-solving in 
            design. I thrive in collaborative and fast-paced environments, bringing creativity, critical
            thinking, and attention to detail to every project. I aim to create innovative, 
            user-centered work that combines art, technology, writing, and thoughtful design.
