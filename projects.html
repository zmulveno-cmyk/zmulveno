        <h3>Double Death</h3>
        <p>For this project, we were told to created our own sports
          drink label. I was insipired by one of my favorite show
          as a kid, Regular Show. The episode is called "Death 
          Sandwich" refering to the sandwich in the show that was 
          called Double Death. Just like sandwich in the show, if 
          not consumed correctly can lead to death. Season 4, 
          episode 13.
          I made this using Adobe Ilustrator.

        <h3>Phantoms</h3>
        <p>For this project, we had to recreate a poem from the text in 
         The Plato's Allegory. 
          “The release from the bonds, the turning around from the shadows, to the
          phantoms and the light from the cave to the sun; the divine appearances, the
          things that are, rather that as before phantoms cast by a light”. One consistent
          theme from Plato’s Allegory that stood out to me is the illusion of reality and
          how one perceives what to be true. "... of the objects which are being carried in
          like manner, they would only see the shadows... if they were able to converse
          with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was
          actually before them....". This quote to me emphasizes the fact that the prisoner
          uses abstract knowledge while being in the state of darkness. This darkness
          pertains to ignorance so, in this state the prisoners still try to gain some truth of
          their surroundings. Unknowing to what these shadows are being controlled for
          them by something greater than what they can imagine. “To them, I said, the
          truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images." Here Socrates
          explains that the prisoner would have no idea what is beyond the shadows and
          darkness. All along the shadows was just an extension of the light, making us
          question more than what our eyes allowed us to see. Making you question how
          this could be along and you had no idea. This aporic feeling of not knowing
          anything about anything. Like finding out you aren’t really who you were told
          you are. A shift in your existence or new learning material for your brain.
          Depending on how you see things.
          In my poem the part “the turning over from the shadows” expresses the
          change from light to dark. The enlightenment of the brain. Knowledge. Seeing
          what is, for what it is. Like getting to the other side of the mountain. Like seeing
          both sides of the coin. Yet, sometimes this harsh reality is hard to settle into.
          Like when the prisoner finally leaves the cage and sees beyond shadows. He
          saw the sun, grass, flowers, water, rocks and everything for the first time, it was
          a sense of freedom. A sense of knowing not knowing all at once. Reflecting back
          to once was and trying to understand the was and now at the same time. Not
          being bound to another prisoner, day upon day and only knowing nothing but
          what was. When the sunlight hit his skin, his mind was opened to what casted
          the shadows in the cave. This darkness is casted by light.
          “The divine appearance”. The word divine can be interchangeable for a
          few di erent meanings. 1. Godly or godlike, 2. To discover by intuition; insight.
          Nowthe divine appearance can be referred to as both. Once the prisoner looks
          from the light to the shadow this “divine appearance” is apparent. Once
          discovering this outside force was really in control of what he thought to be true.
          Unlike the prisoners who were still their in a controlled environment, unaware of
          what lie right behind them.
          “The thing that are, rather than as before.” “The things that are” refer to
          truth, wisdom and ideas etc. “Rather than as before” when darkness was the
          one truth. The term “Dark Ages” was given this name because of the lack of
          intellectual and cultural advance. The Renaissance came and with that came
          enlightenment as well. The “Enlightenment Period” refers to the free thinking
          and questions of oneself and their surroundings. Just like when the prisoner
          escaped the cave. Dark Ages to the Enlightenment period with just a walk up
          the stairs from the cave. The sense of enlightenment and knowledge of its
          surroundings but also questioning what's around them.
          “Phantom cast by a light”. Phantoms can be indicated as spirit or soul.
          Without the light we are unable to see anything. We are unable to see or know
          from right or wrong. Without seeing or knowing there is no light and dark.
          Without the balance perhaps there would be nothing at all
          In myartwork, I wanted to emphasize the dark and light. In the
          background of the poem, I went for a simple approach. I didn’t want anything
          to overpower the poem. In the middle of the bottom part, I added a butterfly to
          symbolize a human soul. In Greek mythology, Psyche, a mortal woman goes
          through all the tests to see her love Eros again. Psyche's willingness to go trial
          after trial to see her love again. This shows humans eternal stride to what
          motivates them. I put the butterfly between both light and dark to mirror the
          prisoner's journey from light to the dark. Also making the sun that's behind the
          butterfly kinda bright so it stands out. While in the corner, the left part of the
          wing is in the darkness.“The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.”

          I took the orginal photo and put it in to Photshop to create more of a

        <p> For this project, we were tasked with photoshop a picture of 
          yourself into and another picture. Using Adobe Photshop, Ai was my 
          best friend for this one. Extending the picture from the waist down. 
          Add more the background, removing my name tag in the pictuce of myself. 
          Changing the filter on the picture with thumbs to fit the orignal.
